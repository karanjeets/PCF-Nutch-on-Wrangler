# PCF - Nutch on Wrangler

A Portable Crawling Framework (PCF) for [Apache Nutch 1.x](http://nutch.apache.org/) to run on [TACC Wrangler](https://www.tacc.utexas.edu/systems/wrangler), a supercomputer funded by NSF.

This came out from another project - "Crawl Evaluation" where we evaluated Apache Nutch v1.12 on Wrangler in both Hadoop and Local mode thereby pushing the crawler to its limits for a best throughput. It also includes some of the challenging stuff - Broad crawling, Focused crawling, Intelligent Crawling, Domain Discovery and many more...

This project has a sample crawling workspace named Portable Crawling Framework (PCF) for Wrangler which is both automated and portable. More details can be found from the respective README files.
